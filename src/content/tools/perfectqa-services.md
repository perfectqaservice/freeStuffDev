Automation Testing Life Cycle is a structured approach, comprising different phases from planning and assessment to maintenance. Unlike the manual testing life cycle, ATLC goes with predefined test cases that are executed with the help of automation tools and provides an easier and accurate way of defect identification. ATLC in a nutshell is a game-changer and would be used to ensure, in an Agile and DevOps practices-led environment, that testing gets aligned with the continuous integration and delivery pipelines to deploy software of high quality at a rapid pace.
